    <h1>Happy Birthday!</h1>
    <p>
        From the classroom to our endless conversations, every moment spent with you has become a treasured memory.
        <br><br>
        You've filled my days with so much joy, warmth, and light. Being around you, I found not only a friend but someone who makes everything feel more beautiful. And somewhere along the way, I realized that I had fallen in love with you. Your kindness, your laughter, and your beautiful soul have a way of making everything better.
        <br><br>
        Today, I celebrate not just your birthday, but the incredible person you are. I'm so grateful for every memory we've created together and excited for all the moments yet to come. May your day be as bright and wonderful as you are, filled with all the happiness you bring to others.
        <br><br>
        Happy Birthday once again, Sejal. You mean the world to me, and I hope this year brings you nothing but joy and success.
        <br><br>
        With all my heart,<br>
        Jeet Gupta
